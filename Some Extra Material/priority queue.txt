depends on the priority of the elements.

the element with highest priority will be moved to the front of the queue and with lowest priority will move to the back of the queue.
Thus it is possible that when u enqueue an element at the back of the queue it can move to the front due to it's higher priority.

4 -> 4
8 -> 8 4
1 -> 8 4 1
7 -> 8 7 4 1
3 -> 8 7 4 3 1
